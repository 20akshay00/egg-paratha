### The Recipe 

Weekly sessions on fun ways to use code to explore ideas in physics. We will have two levels spanning over the year 2022. LVL 1 is primarily aimed at newbies: the first and second year students.

- **LVL 1:** simulating basic physics using code, with emphasis on visuals over accuracy. 
- **LVL 2:** ease into what egg-paratha was meant to be; exploration of more advanced topics with increasing emphasis on accuracy/utility over visuals.

**Check out a tentative list of topics we have in mind [here](topics.md).**

#### Ingredients (Event structure):
- Sessions once a week (or twice every three weeks), 1-3 hrs duration 
- A topic/broad area of exploration (like the ones listed above) is chosen for each session
- Some MS18/19/20 person hosts each session (ideally different ones each time, based on their level of experience/interest in that weeks topic). They will organize the session, and act as a guide for people implementing the stuff.

#### Method (Session structure):
- Start by throwing around ideas, see what people think is a good approach to solve the task
- Small presentation by the host, teaching/introducing whatever relevant concepts required 
- Code-along-with-me for the basic simulation (host goes through implementation, while participants try to do it on their own as well)
- Based on time constraints/complexity of the problem, explorations (Progression/Explore) will be left to the participants to attempt on their own and discuss passively (over discord or during the next sessions).
