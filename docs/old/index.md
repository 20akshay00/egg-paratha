# Egg Paratha 2021 

Welcome to Egg paratha, the Phi@I computational physics discussion group. **\*\*Insert Turing Club collaboration line here\*\***.

Phi@I and Turing Club, is introducing Weekly Computational Physics discussion sessions!

### Why Egg Paratha

We've named this Egg Paratha, and you'll get to know the reason for this in the sessions.

### What we'll do

The sessions will include some introduction to the problems of the week every Friday evening, and discussions over the next week over our Discord server! Contact the conveners for the link to the Discord group!

We don't expect you to come prepared for anything,
because the best way to learn to code is to pick up small projects, 
and that's how we've designed our sessions. 
These sessions would be a great opportunity to learn together and bond over the love of physics and (a bit of) coding.

You all are welcome to come and interact and also suggest new ideas! Definitely get in touch with us if you want to organise a few days!

## Week 1

- [Questions for the week](week1/week1)
- [Slides of Akshay's talk](week1/week1_slides)
