## Previous iterations

Egg-Paratha initially was concieved in 2021 by [Akshay](https://github.com/20akshay00/) and [Dhruva](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/) as a means to encourage discussion on research-oriented computational physics techniques. Unfortunately, it had a short life as the semester took over our time and motivation dwindled. The few sessions held during that time can be found [here](old/index.md).

## Rising from the scramble - Egg Paratha 2022

With the arrival of MS21, we decided that this is a good opportunity to restart Egg-Paratha, albeit with a new set of plans and a focus on long-term sustainability... meaning that we hope the sessions will be carried on by the members of Phi@I over time. 

### The Recipe 

Weekly sessions on fun ways to use code to explore ideas in physics. We will have two levels spanning over the year 2022. LVL 1 is primarily aimed at newbies: the first and second year students.

- **LVL 1:** simulating basic physics using code, with emphasis on visuals over accuracy. 
- **LVL 2:** ease into what egg-paratha was meant to be; exploration of more advanced topics with increasing emphasis on accuracy/utility over visuals.

**Check out a tentative list of topics we have in mind [here](topics.md).**

#### Ingredients (Event structure):
- Sessions once a week (or twice every three weeks), 1-3 hrs duration 
- A topic/broad area of exploration (like the ones listed above) is chosen for each session
- Some MS18/19/20 person hosts each session (ideally different ones each time, based on their level of experience/interest in that weeks topic). They will organize the session, and act as a guide for people implementing the stuff.

#### Method (Session structure):
- Start by throwing around ideas, see what people think is a good approach to solve the task
- Small presentation by the host, teaching/introducing whatever relevant concepts required 
- Code-along-with-me for the basic simulation (host goes through implementation, while participants try to do it on their own as well)
- Based on time constraints/complexity of the problem, explorations (Progression/Explore) will be left to the participants to attempt on their own and discuss passively (over discord or during the next sessions).

### Proposed Language to code in: Julia
Firstly, languages like C++ and Fortran are eliminated immediately. Although they do have a place in scientific computing, they are quite a hassle to work with for the kind of interactive explorations that we would like to do.

Secondly, we're aware that most people are likely to have experience in python, but the syntactic switch to perform basic tasks is fairly simple (**familiarity with basic programming concepts has more relevance here**). Julia is preferred for reasons that will become clear over the course of the sessions.. but right off the bat, it is very convenient for scientific computing, and making plot-based animations is a breeze compared to python. We will discuss basic syntax and features as the sessions progress.

To ease this process, we have collated some useful [Julia resources](resources.md). If this is too much work, you can of course stick to your preferred language of choice, as the take-away from these sessions are meant to be new ways of thinking, rather than exploring the nuances of a particular language. 

**Note:** Any potential hosts who are comfortable only with python are still encouraged to host sessions.

Everyone is welcome to join us and suggest new ideas! Do get in touch if you want to host a few sessions!
